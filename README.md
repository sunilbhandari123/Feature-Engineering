# Different type of missing Missing Data


# 1. Missing Completely at random (MCAR)


There is no absolute relationship between the data missing and any other values observed or missing within the datasets.


# 2. Missing Data not at random (MNAR)

There is absolute some relationship between the data missing and any other values,observed or missing within the datasets.


# 3. Missing At Random



# Technique of handeling missing values


1. Mean/Median Mode Replacement.
2. Random Sample Imputation
3. Capturing Nan values with a new features
4. End of distrubtion imputation
5. Abitaracy imputation
6. Frequency Categories Imputation


# 1. Mean/Median/Mode Replacement 

used at MCAR 
Replacable NAN with most frequent occurance of the variable
After replacement check the standard deviation if the difference is small then it is fine otherwise it is the matter of worries.
